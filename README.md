# DMM_Analisis
These routines were developed to carry out the following operations:   (1) Allow the user to define the regions of analysis. This was done for the first image of each animal; the program then stabilized all subsequent images by using the previous image as reference.  (2) Define “patches” of intensity differences within each image, and   (3) Calculate a “Roughness index” based either on the sum of the standard deviation between each pixel and those immediately surrounding it (“Standard deviation” algorithm), or the sum of the perimeter of each patch (“Borders” algorithm).  To run, load "lib" and execute Java2Python.jar   Check DMM_Analisis_Manual.pdf for instructions.
